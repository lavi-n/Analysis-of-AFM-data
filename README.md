# Analysis-of-AFM-data

These Programs calculate and analyse morphological properties of a surface measured by the Atomic force microscopy data.
The input data will be a 2 dimension square matrix (typically 256 by 256 or 512 by 512 size) of the scan area of ~ 2, 5 or 10 square microns.
the programs calculate the average roughness, RMS roughness and the histogram profile of the surface.
They also calculate the height difference correlation function and fit it assuming a self-affine structure.
A routine for fitting the PSD data from AFM measurements is also included.
